# ‚úâÔ∏è Notification CLI (n-cli) - Send notifications to yourself through the command line

Why stare at your laptop when you can go make yourself a coffee and have your computer let you know when it's done compiling that monstrous 4GB monorepo?

# üöÄ Features

- Works out-of-the-box - no need to go through any external service (other than your chat apps, of course)
- Desktop notification
- Discord notification through [Discord webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

Do open an issue if you're interested in a notification channel being implemented.

# üêà Usage

```sh
n-cli --help

# send "My message here" to your configured destinations. if you haven't configured n-cli, we'll setup a config for you
n-cli send My message here
n-cli s My message here

# example - make build takes 20 minutes to complete
make build; n-cli s "Build is done, stop making coffee"

# alternatively, run your shell command through n-cli
n-cli run make build

# make sure to use `--` if you'd like to pass in flags
n-cli r -- make build --whatever-args-i-have-here

# pro tip: you can set an alias to make the whole command shorter
alias n="n-cli s"
make build; n Build is done;

# useful commands
n-cli init # optional: initializes & configures n-cli without running anything
n-cli where config # where is your config?
n-cli version # get version
